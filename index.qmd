## Hello there!

I'm an assistant professor in the [Department of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture](https://agsci.colostate.edu/department/horticulture-and-landscape-architecture/) in the [College of Agricultural Sciences](https://agsci.colostate.edu) at [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu). I received a PhD in environmental conservation, with an emphasis in forest resources and arboriculture, from the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu) in 2020.

I study the trees and forests cultivated amid communities to benefit people. I am interested in the persistence and preservation of large, mature trees facing various disturbances in cities, and I work to identify the natural adaptations and management interventions conferring longevity to individual trees and, at broader scales, limiting mortality rates in urban forests.

I also teach courses on the science and practice of urban tree and forest management, and I work with practitioners, policymakers, and other stakeholders to improve community trees and forests for the health and safety of nearby populations.

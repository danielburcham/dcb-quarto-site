I received a PhD in environmental conservation, with an emphasis in forest resources and arboriculture, from the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu) in 2020.\n\nI study the trees and forests cultivated amid communities to benefit people. I am interested in the persistence and preservation of large, mature trees facing various disturbances in cities, and I work to identify the natural adaptations and management interventions conferring longevity to individual trees and, at broader scales, limiting mortality rates in urban forests.\n\nI also teach courses on the science and practice of urban tree and forest management, and I work with practitioners, policymakers, and other stakeholders to improve community trees and forests for the health and safety of nearby populations.\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n## Selected Projects\n\n#### Peer-reviewed journal articles\n\n**Identifying modal properties of trees with Bayesian inference.** Burcham, D.C. and Au, S.K. 2022.

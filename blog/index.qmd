For me, learning and scientific discovery are lifelong pursuits, and I hope to share some of my personal journey and, hopefully, the fruit of my labor with everyone. Here, I will post regular updates about ongoing projects, explore promising ideas or research methods, and create helpful teaching materials or illustrations.

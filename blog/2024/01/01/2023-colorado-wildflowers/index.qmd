## Confessions of an outsider

When I first moved to Fort Collins, I was honestly dismayed by the lack of green plant life, apart from a short burst of growth in the spring, in most natural areas. In earlier stages of my life, I always lived in places with relatively more rain, and I overlooked the dependence of all life on the reliable presence of water. After grieving the loss of chlorophyll, I slowly began to appreciate the impressive diversity of plants living in the semi-arid steppe climate. Like the people, the plants living in the west have adapted with sophisticated strategies to thrive in the harsh conditions with unique attractiveness, and I increasingly regard the subtle beauty of dryland plants with great partiality. In truth, the initial disappointment was merely an opportunity to change perspectives on a beloved subject. 

## Discovering beauty on the trail

Fortunately, the growing season last year offered some spectacular wildflower displays after a very snowy winter in most of Colorado. I relished the opportunity to explore some of the state's impressive landscapes and see the unmatched beauty and variety of colorful blossoms. Over the summer, I enjoyed a new wildflower hike nearly every weekend, and it would take a lifetime to enjoy the remaining untraveled trails. As I reflect on 2023, I am grateful for the experiences of the past year and excited to discover more natural beauty, in all its facets, in the year ahead. 

Below, you can see a few of my discoveries and, potentially, some inspiration for your own outdoor adventures!

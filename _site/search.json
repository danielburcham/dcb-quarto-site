    "text": "Recently, the Colorado State University (CSU) weather station recorded a daily low temperature of -15.4° F in the early morning of 22 December 2022. At the time, wind chills varying between -50° and -35° F threatened lives across most of the Eastern plains in Colorado. The frigid temperatures accompanied a string of unpleasant winter weather for much of the US with many places experiencing bitter cold, gusty winds, and heavy snow; and the unfortunate timing of the weather only compounded the frustrations of many people traveling over the holidays.\nCold weather snaps are common in Colorado, and the plants and people living here must equally tolerate occasional severe freezing. Fortunately, many trees easily endure freezing temperatures during the winter months - the vegetative buds on most deciduous broadleaf trees withstand temperatures between -13° and -37° F (-25° and -35° C). Occasionally, though, some cultivated trees are injured or killed by low temperatures, especially if temperatures drop abruptly after relatively warm weather (e.g., false springs) or the species was introduced from a milder climate. The sudden freezes can be especially harmful if trees are not acclimated to freezing temperatures; the events can damage buds, leaves, and flowers and, in some cases, disrupt water conduction or natural growth patterns. In recent years, for example, several freeze events killed large numbers of Siberian elms (Ulmus pumila) along the Front Range, and I have heard similar stories about widespread tree damage caused by unusual fall freezes in earlier decades."

    "text": "Freezing tolerance in trees\nTrees use a number of strategies to tolerate freezing temperatures during winter, including withdrawing water into non-living tissues where ice formation avoids damage to living cells, lowering the freezing point of the water retained in cells, and forming physical barriers restricting the propagation of ice crystals. As temperatures fall below freezing, extracellular ice draws out some of the water retained in living cells along an osmotic gradient between the two phases of water, and trees further modify their living cells to tolerate the desiccation during freezing. In addition to leaf shedding, the modifications are all part of a tree’s yearly preparations for the winter season.\nThe seasonal pattern of cold hardiness is U-shaped with trees increasingly hardy to progressively lower freezing temperatures during the fall, consistently hardy to a minimum temperature during the winter, and decreasingly hardy during the spring. Crucially, the timing of seasonal transitions ensures that a tree’s physiological activity matches changing environmental conditions. There is broad agreement that day length and temperature mainly govern the acquisition and loss of cold hardiness, respectively, in the fall and spring each year, but individual tree species also display a unique sensitivity to the two seasonal environmental cues for spring emergence. Some species, like green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) and Siberian elm, are more sensitive to temperature during bud burst in the spring, and others, like white ash (Fraxinus americana) and littleleaf linden (Tilia cordata), are more sensitive to day length during the same transition. The heavy reliance on fickle temperatures for seasonal transitions may explain the winter damage more commonly observed on the former two species, but the seasonal cues for many species are also moderated by a chilling (accumulated low temperature) requirement that, if unfulfilled, prevents premature bud burst.\nFor a given species, the precise timing of spring budburst is determined by the maximum cold hardiness, accumulated low winter temperatures (i.e., chilling), warm spring temperatures (i.e., forcing), and increasing spring day length (i.e., photoperiod). In many places, scientists have observed a steady advancement of biological spring towards earlier times of the year amid the warming climate, and the risk of freeze damage during false springs may be especially significant for trees, depending on the rate of cold hardiness loss during spring. In Colorado, wild temperature fluctuations are already commonplace in the spring and fall, and many people have learned to simply avoid planting trees tending to leaf out early or retain leaves late in the season. Moving forward, it will still be important to consider tree phenology when evaluating the possibility of planting new species in our landscapes."

    "text": "Statistics of extremes\nRecently, I received a summary of extreme low temperatures in Fort Collins during the 20th Century, and the report clearly showed that our predecessors on the Front Range endured much colder days. Curious about recent trends, I decided to update the summary with more recent observations and explore the use of extreme value analysis to characterize severe freezing events in Fort Collins using the extRemes package in R. Instead of evaluating more commonplace conditions, extreme value distributions depict the occurrence of maximum (or minimum) values in a data set. Usefully, they can characterize extreme climate processes without a mechanistic treatment of the underlying physical phenomena. They have been used to statistically describe the probability of very rare or extreme events, such as severe “100-year” floods, and they have yielded important design criteria for engineers anticipating the limits of environmental conditions affecting buildings or infrastructure. The cumulative density function (CDF) for the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution can be defined as: \\[F(x;\\mu,\\sigma,\\gamma)=e^{-[1-\\gamma(x-\\mu)/\\sigma]^{1/\\gamma}} \\tag{1}\\] where \\(\\gamma\\ne0\\) and \\([1-\\gamma(x-\\mu)/\\sigma]>0\\). The three parameters \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\sigma\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) depict the location, scale, and shape of the distribution. The location parameter, \\(\\mu\\), represents the most common, i.e., modal, extreme value. The scale parameter, \\(\\sigma\\), portrays the rate of change in \\(x\\) with the natural logarithm of time, and the ration \\(\\sigma/\\gamma\\) represents the maximum extreme value. The return level, \\(x\\), associated with a return period, \\(T\\), corresponds to the \\(1-p\\) quantile of the distribution, where \\(p=1/T\\). For example, a 100-year return level would correspond to the \\(1-{1\\over100}=0.99\\) quantile. Return levels can be obtained using the quantile function: \\[F^{-1}(1-p;\\mu,\\sigma,\\gamma)=\\mu+(\\sigma/\\gamma)\\{{1\\over[-ln(1-p)]^\\gamma}-1\\} \\tag{2}\\] where \\(\\gamma\\ne0\\). The interpretation of a return level often causes confusion, but it is simply the value expected to be exceeded, on average, once every \\(T\\) years.\nTo update the data, I consolidated the 20th Century weather data from Fort Collins contained in extRemes with more recent observations from the same weather station. Currently, the weather station is situated on the main campus of CSU near the Lory Student Center. The station was originally located near the former “Old Main” building with observations starting on 1 January 1889.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(extRemes)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(httr)\nlibrary(jsonlite)\nlibrary(modelsummary)\n\n# Load FCwx data from extRemes package\ndata(FCwx)\n\n# Query updated FCwx observations and combine\napi <- GET(\"http://www.coagmet.colostate.edu/data/daily/fcl01.json?from=2000-01-01&to=2022-12-31&fields=tMax,tMin,precip\")\nFCwx2k <- do.call(cbind.data.frame,fromJSON(rawToChar(api$content))) |> \n  mutate(dt = as.Date(time,\"%Y-%m-%d\"), Dy = yday(dt), Mn = month(dt), Year = year(dt)) |>\n  select(dt,Dy,Mn,Year,tMin) |> rename(MnT = tMin)\n\nFCwx <- FCwx |> mutate(dt = as.Date(paste(Dy,\"-\",Mn,\"-\",Year),\"%d - %m - %Y\")) |>\n  select(dt,Dy,Mn,Year,MnT)\n\nFCwx <- bind_rows(FCwx,FCwx2k) |> mutate(doy = yday(dt))\nFCwx <- FCwx[FCwx$MnT != -999,]\n\nwindowsFonts(Inter = windowsFont(\"Inter\"))\n\ntheme_nice <- function() {\n  theme_minimal(base_family = \"Inter\") + \n    theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n          panel.spacing.x = unit(10, \"points\"),\n          plot.title = element_text(family= \"Inter\", face = \"bold\"),\n          axis.title = element_text(family = \"Inter\"),\n          strip.text = element_text(family = \"Inter\", face = \"bold\",\n                                    size = rel(1), hjust = 0),\n          strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"grey80\", color = NA))\n}\n\nupdate_geom_defaults(\"label\", list(family=\"Inter\"))\nupdate_geom_defaults(ggtext::GeomRichText, list(family=\"Inter\"))\n\nBetween 1900 and 2022, there were 19,632 days with low temperatures below freezing in Fort Collins (approximately 44% of all observed days).

Near the lower limit of the observed range, there were 73 days with low temperatures below -20° F, but such extremely cold days were not observed uniformly over the past 122 years: 79.5% of the events occurred before 1950.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data=FCwx,aes(x=dt,y=MnT)) + \n  geom_point(alpha=0.5,position=\"jitter\") + \n  geom_smooth() + \n  xlab(\"Date\") + ylab(\"Daily Minimum Temperature\") + \n  theme_nice()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Daily minimum temperatures in Fort Collins, CO between 1900 and 2022\n\n\n\n\nIn the entire data record (Figure 1), there is an obvious upward trend in the daily minimum temperatures over time, and you can also clearly see more variability in the lower limit of observations. As a convenient starting point, I simply fit a GEV distribution to all observations. The location parameter for the preliminary fit, for example, indicated that the most common daily minimum temperature was 41.6° F (Table 1). For such cases, one important modeling assumption requires the use of homogeneous data obtained from a process not undergoing any systematic change. In many cases, however, extreme value processes exhibit slowly-varying or cyclical behavior, and the probability of an extreme event, often, varies according to diurnal, seasonal, or annual conditions.\n\n# Fit stationary model\nfit0 <- fevd(-MnT ~ 1, FCwx, type = \"GEV\", span = 123, units = \"deg F\", time.units = \"days\", period.basis = \"year\")\n\n# Stationary model summary table\nfit0.summary <- summary(fit0, silent=TRUE)\nparams.ci.fit0 <- data.frame(matrix(ci(fit0, type = \"parameter\"),ncol=3))\ncolnames(params.ci.fit0) <- c(\"ll\",\"est\",\"ul\")\nfit0.model.summary <- params.ci.fit0 |> \n  mutate(estimate = paste(round(params.ci.fit0$est,digits=2),\" (\",round(params.ci.fit0$ll,digits=2),\", \",round(params.ci.fit0$ul,digits=2),\")\", sep = \"\")) |>\n  select(estimate)\nfit0.model.summary <- data.frame(params = c(\"Location, &#956;\",\"Scale, &#963;\",\"Shape, &#947;\"), fit0.model.summary)\n\nfootnote(kbl(fit0.model.summary, format=\"html\", booktabs=TRUE, col.names=c(\"Parameters\", \"Estimate (95% CI)\"), row.names=FALSE, digits=2, align=\"lc\", escape=FALSE) |> \n  column_spec(1,width=\"10em\") |>\n  column_spec(2,width=\"12em\") |> \n  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position=\"left\"), paste(\"Negative log-likelihood (NLLH): \",round(fit0$results$value,2),\"; Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC): \",round(fit0.summary$BIC,2), sep=\"\"), footnote_as_chunk = TRUE)\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Parameter estimates for stationary Generalized Extreme Value distribution fit to negative daily minimum temperatures in Fort Collins, CO between 1900 and 2022 \n \n  \n    Parameters \n    Estimate (95% CI) \n  \n \n\n  \n    Location, μ \n    -41.64 (-41.8, -41.48) \n  \n  \n    Scale, σ \n    15.26 (15.15, 15.38) \n  \n  \n    Shape, γ \n    -0.14 (-0.14, -0.13) \n  \n\n\nNote:   Negative log-likelihood (NLLH): 189790.29; Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC): 379612.71\n\n\n\n\n\nFortunately, it is possible to account for non-stationary extremes by directly modeling variation in the distribution parameters.

This is consistent with the increasing trend in daily minimum temperatures observed in Figure 1. Compared to the location parameter, the other two parameters do not similarly vary over time. However, it’s intuitively reasonable to expect seasonal variation in daily minimum temperatures, and a simply harmonic function can be used to model cyclical variation in seasonal lows. For the non-stationary case, I fit two candidate models: one modeling annual and seasonal variation in the location parameter and a second modeling additional seasonal variation in the scale parameter.

    "text": "Tree pruning creates wounds that are amenable for wood decay fungi colonization. To characterize the dynamic host–fungus interactions at this location in Senegal mahogany (Khaya senegalensis), in vitro and in vivo pathogenicity tests were conducted with wood decay fungi associated with this tropical tree species. Fomitiporella caryophylii, Hymenochaete murina and Phellinus noxius isolates were included in this experiment following their frequent isolation from Senegal mahogany pruning wounds. The evaluated isolates demonstrated unique host interactions in laboratory tests that suggest equally divergent prognoses for living Senegal mahoganies affected by these fungi. Although all evaluated fungal isolates successfully breached naturally induced reaction zones, P. noxius alone caused significant mass loss to incubated wood blocks. In addition, P. noxius caused extensive wood decay after inoculation in living hosts, successfully illustrating Koch’s postulates for this host–fungus relationship. The wood decay ability, invasiveness and facultative parasitism demonstrated by P. noxius suggest its dominant role in wood decay columns below pruning wounds on living Senegal mahoganies. These results highlight the importance of characterizing specific host–fungus interactions and their implications for wood decay severity below pruning wounds in living trees."

    "title": "Field evaluation of Trichoderma spp. as a biological control agent to prevent wood decay on Benin mahogany (Khaya grandifoliola) and rain tree (Samanea saman) in Singapore",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In paired field experiments, two Trichoderma sp. isolates were evaluated for their ability to separately prevent wood decay on the pruning wounds of Benin mahogany (Khaya grandifoliola) and rain tree (Samanea saman)in Singapore. For each species, 150 pruning wounds were created among 10 trees and received either a conidial suspension of the biological control agent or no treatment. At regular intervals, the ability of the isolates to colonize wounds was evaluated using selective fungal isolations, and wound wood occlusion was simultaneously monitored by successive wound diameter measurements. After 18 months, the wounds were harvested and dissected to measure the size of wood discoloration columns. Overall, relatively superior outcomes for the biological control of wood decay were observed on rain tree compared to Benin mahogany. Trichoderma spp. were approximately twice as abundant on the treated wounds of rain tree than Benin mahogany at all times during the experiment. Although the Trichoderma spp. isolates were effectively inoculated onto the pruning wounds of both species, they were isolated at rates that declined by approximately half over the 18-month experiment. Compared to non-treated controls, rain tree pruning wounds treated with T. harzianum 9132 had significantly less wood discoloration and greater wound wood occlusion, but the same treatment effects were not observed on Benin mahogany using T. virens W23. The results demonstrate that T. harzianum 9132 is an effective biological control agent for wood decay on rain tree, and the treatment effects offer a valuable way to limit the biological and mechanical costs of tree pruning."

    "title": "Identifying modal properties of trees with Bayesian inference",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In forested landscapes, the presence of trees enhances turbulent airflow governing the exchange of momentum, heat, and gas between the atmosphere and biosphere, especially when horizontal motion dominates near-surface winds, and tree vibration is a prominent feature of the dynamic interaction between wind and trees. The vibration characteristics of trees reflect their underlying mechanical properties (i.e., mass, stiffness, damping) and govern their response to dynamic loads. Despite numerous investigations of tree vibration, there have been few studies examining methodological improvements for identifying and characterizing variability in the modal properties of trees during ambient wind excitation. In the engineering disciplines, however, there are several techniques commonly used to estimate the modal properties of a structure from its ambient vibration, often called ‘operational modal analysis’ (OMA). Operating in the frequency domain, this study examined the use of Bayesian OMA for identifying several important modal properties, including frequencies, damping ratios, and partial mode shapes, as well as their identification uncertainty. Using the ambient vibration recorded on a mature Hopea odorata Roxb. (Dipterocarpaceae) tree over a one-week period, the identified modal properties and associated uncertainties were physically reasonable and consistent with previous measurements for trees, and the identification uncertainty was much greater for damping ratio than frequency, which can be explained theoretically. Beyond the consistency with existing measurements, the analysis also yielded new insight about the vibration behavior of large trees. The modal properties varied considerably over consecutive one-hour intervals, and the changes were likely related to differences in wind excitation during each period, suggesting the existence of amplitude dependence in the modal properties of trees. Over the same periods, there were consistently two close modes (i.e., with similar frequencies), oriented approximately orthogonal to one another, near the tree’s fundamental frequency. With additional evaluation and refinement, the techniques can be used for OMA of trees in different settings."

    "section": "",
    "text": "During pruning, arborists often intend to increase a tree’s resistance to wind loading by selectively removing branches, but there are few studies examining the efficacy of these interventions, especially for large, open-grown trees. This study examined the vibration properties (frequency and damping ratio) and mass of Senegal mahogany (Khaya senegalensis) and rain tree (Samanea saman) before and after a series of pruning treatments: crowns were either raised or reduced at incremental severities between 0 and 80%. For both species, mass decreased faster on reduced than raised trees. The frequency and damping ratio of trees varied with the severity of pruning for reduced, but not raised, trees. The frequency of reduced trees generally increased with pruning severity. In contrast, damping ratio of reduced trees generally decreased with the severity of pruning, except for the unique increase in damping ratio on Senegal mahoganies reduced by 10–20%. Although the vibration properties and mass will change as trees grow after pruning, the results suggest that arborists can reduce trees to change their vibration properties and concomitant response to wind loads, but arborists should reduce trees by a small amount to avoid the adverse decrease in damping ratio."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Pruning is commonly used to mitigate the risk of tree failure by selectively removing tree parts exposed to the wind, but there have been few studies examining changes in wind loads after pruning, especially for large, open- grown trees. In this study, the wind-induced vibration and bending moments of Senegal mahogany (Khaya senegalensis) were monitored before and after a series of pruning treatments: crowns were either raised or reduced at incremental severities between 0 and 20 %. Under ambient wind loads, axial trunk deformation was measured using two displacement probes installed orthogonally on each tree, and each displacement probe was calibrated using a static load test to convert the measured trunk deformation to a bending moment. During each pruning treatment, ambient wind conditions and trunk deformation were monitored simultaneously for extended periods of time. As pruning severity increased, Fourier spectra showed that raised trees continued to vibrate primarily at their fundamental mode, but reduced trees vibrated progressively less than raised trees. Similarly, the average 30-minute maximum bending moment, associated with a given 30-minute maximum wind speed, decreased more for reduced than raised trees. Consistent with existing studies of small trees, the results suggest that arborists should reduce trees to decrease wind loads and, concomitantly, the likelihood of tree failure. Still, excessive leaf loss may constrain the usefulness of increasingly severe pruning on reduced trees: average leaf area index decreased by half on trees reduced by 20 %. More work is needed to understand the long-term physiological and mechanical consequences of pruning treatments."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The measurement and assessment of internal defects is an important aspect of tree risk assessment. Although there are several methods for estimating the reduced load-bearing capacity of trees with internal defects, the advancement of these methods has not kept pace with improvements to methods used to measure the internal condition of trees, such as sonic tomography. In this study, the percent reduction to the section modulus, ZLOSS (%), caused by internal defects was estimated using 51 sonic tomograms collected from three tree species, and the accuracy of measurements was assessed using the destructively measured internal condition of the corresponding cross sections. In tomograms, there was a repeated underestimation of the percent total damaged area, AD(%), and a repeated overestimation of the offset distance between the centroid of the trunk and the centroid of the largest damaged part, LO (m). As a result, ZLOSS determined using tomograms was mostly less, in absolute terms, than that determined from destructive measurements. However, the accuracy of these estimates improved when using colors associated with intermediate sonic velocities to select damaged parts in tomograms, in addition to the colors explicitly associated with the slowest sonic velocities. Among seven mathematical methods used to estimate ZLOSS, those accounting for LO were more accurate than others neglecting it. In particular, a numerical method incorporating greater geometric detail, called zloss, gave estimates that were consistently better than six other analytical methods."

    "title": "Geometry matters for sonic tomography of trees",
    "section": "",
    "text": "For trees growing in communities, arborists routinely check for evidence of damaged wood during tree risk assessment, and sonic tomography is occasionally used to measure the amount of internal damage in trees. Existing studies investigating the accuracy of commercially available sonic tomography devices have mostly considered a limited range of measurement conditions, limiting their application in practice. Using measurements incorporating greater variability in test conditions, this study examined the accuracy of sonic tomography by comparing the percent damaged cross-sectional area in tomograms with the destructively measured internal condition of trees. Although the accuracy of tomograms differed between the examined temperate and tropical tree species, the variation was largely explained by underlying differences in the cross-sectional geometry of the measured tree parts. The amount of decay was repeatedly underestimated in measurements of small, circular cross sections, and, conversely, it was consistently overestimated in measurements of large, irregularly shaped cross sections. Using different approaches to generating and interpreting tomograms, a wide range of decay estimates was obtained for a given set of measurements. By adjusting software settings, it was possible to obtain tomograms with the least error for a given cross-sectional geometry, and the tomograms could be visually interpreted to similarly compensate for the anticipated measurement error. Although practitioners can use the identified strategies to compensate for the expected measurement error in different situations, there is also a fundamental need to develop improved measurement and analysis routines for sonic tomography relying on physically realistic assumptions about acoustic wave propagation in wood."

    "title": "An architectural understanding of natural sway frequencies in trees",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The relationship between form and function in trees is the subject of a longstanding debate in forest ecology and provides the basis for theories concerning forest ecosystem structure and metabolism. Trees interact with the wind in a dynamic manner and exhibit natural sway frequencies and damping processes that are important in understanding wind damage. Tree-wind dynamics are related to tree architecture, but this relationship is not well understood. We present a comprehensive view of natural sway frequencies in trees by compiling a dataset of field measurement spanning conifers and broadleaves, tropical and temperate forests. The field data show that a cantilever beam approximation adequately predicts the fundamental frequency of conifers, but not that of broadleaf trees. We also use structurally detailed tree dynamics simulations to test fundamental assumptions underpinning models of natural frequencies in trees. We model the dynamic properties of greater than 1000 trees using a finite-element approach based on accurate three- dimensional model trees derived from terrestrial laser scanning data. We show that (1) residual variation, the variation not explained by the cantilever beam approximation, in fundamental frequencies of broadleaf trees is driven by their architecture; (2) slender trees behave like a simple pendulum, with a single natural frequency dominating their motion, which makes them vulnerable to wind damage and (3) the presence of leaves decreases both the fundamental frequency and the damping ratio. These findings demonstrate the value of new three-dimensional measurements for understanding wind impacts on trees and suggest new directions for improving our understanding of tree dynamics from conifer plantations to natural forests."

    "title": "The motion of trees in the wind: A data synthesis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Interactions between wind and trees control energy exchanges between the atmosphere and forest canopies. This energy exchange can lead to the widespread damage of trees, and wind is a key disturbance agent in many of the world’s forests. However, most research on this topic has focused on conifer plantations, where risk management is economically important, rather than broadleaf forests, which dominate the forest carbon cycle. This study brings together tree motion time-series data to systematically evaluate the factors influencing tree responses to wind loading, including data from both broadleaf and coniferous trees in forests and open environments.\nWe found that the two most descriptive features of tree motion were (a) the fundamental frequency, which is a measure of the speed at which a tree sways and is strongly related to tree height, and (b) the slope of the power spectrum, which is related to the efficiency of energy transfer from wind to trees. Intriguingly, the slope of the power spectrum was found to remain constant from medium to high wind speeds for all trees in this study. This suggests that, contrary to some predictions, damping or amplification mechanisms do not change dramatically at high wind speeds, and therefore wind damage risk is related, relatively simply, to wind speed.\nConifers from forests were distinct from broadleaves in terms of their response to wind loading. Specifically, the fundamental frequency of forest conifers was related to their size according to the cantilever beam model (i.e. vertically distributed mass), whereas broadleaves were better approximated by the simple pendulum model (i.e. dominated by the crown). Forest conifers also had a steeper slope of the power spectrum.We interpret these finding as being strongly elated to tree architecture; i.e. conifers generally have a simple shape due to their apical dominance, whereas broadleaves exhibit a much wider range of architectures with more dominant crowns."
